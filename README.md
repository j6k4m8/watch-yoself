watch-yoself
============

Watches the size of a file change (in wordcount) and then graphs it so you can watch your code/essay/thesis grow, shrink as you edit, and grow as you get close to the deadline and have to binge-write.


Not efficient, not optimized, not complex. Just written for my own curiosity, and uploaded for my own purposes. Feel free to use.

### Usage
`python watch.py` in the directory of choice. Outputs JSON until you Ctrl-C it.

Optionally, use Rickshaw to visualize.
